# Programming-Club

## What do we aim to do in this club? 

Our club aims to bring students in PW who are interested in programming together. We will be looking at some intriguing computer science concepts as well as implementing the concepts in problem solving. All lessons and information that we will discuss in the club meeting would be available to you at the beginning of the meeting in the form of a Word Document.  

We acknowledge the fact that many of you may have lots of programming experience and many of you may not, which is completely fine. In order to accommodate everyone and make our meetings engaging to all of you, we have designed and prepared problems of different difficulties from a variety of competitions. After solving the problems, you can compile your code and see your results on an online judge. Also, you may send your solution to our email address or to our Teams channel, and they will be updated to our clubâ€™s GitHub repository for everyone to see. If you solved a problem and uploaded your solution, the corresponding points you earned will be recorded for the online leaderboard. We strongly encourage and invite any of you who solved the problem or had any ideas to share and discuss as a group. There will be a Microsoft Teams channel set up for members to chat about coding and we will be posting optional problems and quick lessons regularly, for those who are having trouble to understand certain materials from our meetings and for those who are interested to earn some points for the leader board. Further, we will be designing nonmandatory projects such as designing a banking system and hosting in-club competitions with a leader board. There will be year-end prizes for top scorers! 

We will be providing a list of competitions as well as sharing news regarding to the competitions that we encourage you to compete in, such as the Canadian Computing Competition. The club meetings would also prepare you for these competitions.   

Club meetings will happen weekly.
